This framework has been created to test the following-

1. Fetch name, ratings, and movie release year of top 250 TV shows from IMDB site- Done by first test method in test class

2. Verify/Assert that the movie list is displayed correctly under all sorting metrics and orders- I have used assert methods
	to check the sorting metrics. It can also be done by using using Array List and then sorting it for metrics like Release Year
	
3. Sorting is correct for both ascending and descending orders for below criteria- I have found out the xpath of sort icons and 
	compared descending and ascending ordered lists
	
4. I have used Page Object Model for this framework but the xpaths of lists have been used in Test Cases as well so it
	is not purely POM.
	
5. How to run the project- Download the project from the URL and move it to your eclipse work-place. You can also git pull the project.

6. Please make sure to check the pom.xml file for all the dependencies
